# Web Application Scanner

## Overview

The Web Application Scanner project is a Python-based tool designed to automate the discovery of security vulnerabilities in web applications. This tool performs scanning, analysis, and reporting to identify potential weaknesses such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common vulnerabilities, helping developers and security professionals secure their web applications.

## Features

- Automated scanning of web applications for security vulnerabilities.
- Detection of common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
- Crawling and mapping of application structure and endpoints.
- Integration with vulnerability databases and feeds (e.g., CVE).
- Generates detailed reports with identified vulnerabilities and recommendations.
- User-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for configuration and operation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library for sending HTTP requests and handling responses
- `beautifulsoup4` library for HTML parsing and manipulation
- `lxml` library for XML and HTML parsing (optional)
- `sqlmap` for automated SQL injection detection (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/Aravjnth/Web-Application-Scanner-.git
    cd web-application-scanner
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the web application scanner:
    ```bash
    python scan_web_app.py --url <web-application-url>
    ```

2. Review generated reports to prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities.

### Example

Scan a web application for vulnerabilities:
```bash
python scan_web_app.py --url https://example.com
```

## Options

- `--url`: URL of the web application to scan for vulnerabilities.
- Additional configuration options can be customized in `config.py`.
